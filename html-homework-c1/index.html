      <h2>Voluptua</h2>
      <p>
        Voluptua was a master con artist who convinced King Midas to open a gambling palace called the Golden Touch. She and her partner, Segallus, came to have a very strong hold over Midas. They plotted to kill the king so that Segallus could marry Princess Flaxen and become ruler of Midasius. After witnessing an act of heroism by Hercules, Volutptua offered him a large sum to become one of the entertainers at the Golden Touch. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Hercules refused and managed to thwart her plans to rule Midasius. The Golden Touch was closed and Midas put Voluptua and Segallus to work ploughing the fields of Midasius.

      <p>
        Many people ask for the best IDE for programming contests where you don't need all the features than eclipse, <i>Netbeans</i> or VS has, there are many simple editors but only a few editors are really worth using.
      </p>
      <p>Far Manager is a great tool for training in programming comptetitions because you can add lots of plugins avalible for it and extend the power like acced to ftp server, open compressed files, syntax highlighting, etc..</p>

      <h2>Kafka</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Apache Kafka</strong> is a framework implementation of a software bus using stream-processing. It is an open-source software platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Kafka can connect to external systems (for data import/export) via Kafka Connect and provides Kafka Streams, a Java stream processing library. Kafka uses a binary TCP-based protocol that is optimized for efficiency and relies on a "message set" abstraction that naturally groups messages together to reduce the overhead of the network roundtrip. This "leads to larger network packets, larger sequential disk operations, contiguous memory blocks [...] which allows Kafka to turn a bursty stream of random message writes into linear writes."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Kafka was originally developed at <u>LinkedIn</u>, and was subsequently open sourced in early 2011. Jay Kreps, Neha Narkhede and Jun Rao helped co-create Kafka. Graduation from the Apache Incubator occurred on 23 October 2012. Jay Kreps chose to name the software after the author Franz Kafka because it is "a system optimized for writing", and he liked Kafka's work.
